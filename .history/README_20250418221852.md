⚙️ Project Architecture
This project is structured as a static web application that uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive user interface. There is no backend required for this project, but future functionality can include user management or database integration.

🔄 Data Flow
The application dynamically loads the color palettes through JavaScript logic.

The user selects a season (e.g., "Spring").

The appropriate colors for that season are displayed via an image-based display system.

Users can generate a personalized palette by selecting specific colors from the interactive system.
