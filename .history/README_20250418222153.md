🌈 Armocromia Website
Welcome to the Armocromia Website project, a platform dedicated to exploring color palettes and customizing color choices based on your armocromic season type. This website helps users discover and generate color palettes suited to their armocromic subtype using The Color API and includes a test to calculate the user's season based on their physical features (skin tone, eye color, hair color, etc.).

⚙️ Project Architecture
This project is a static web application that uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive user interface. The app also communicates with The Color API to fetch palettes dynamically based on the user’s input.

🔄 Data Flow
Armocromic Test:

The user answers a quiz that asks for details about their skin, eye, and hair color.

Based on the answers, the user's armocromic season (Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter) is calculated.

Palette Generation:

After calculating their armocromic season, the app makes a request to The Color API to fetch the corresponding color palette.

Displaying the Palette:

The system fetches the palette colors and displays them on the UI using an interactive carousel and color blocks.
